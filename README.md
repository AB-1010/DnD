_**Ingemino**_ is a moderately sized walled city on the coast of a large body of water. You, _the Player Character_, were born and have lived your entire life in this city. Make your backstory whatever you like as long as it complies with the world. 
Speaking of which, The world around _Ingemino_ is almost completely unexplored apart due to the immense risk of, well, death when going out exploring for any purpose.
_(Although, there was a group of adventurers who had made great strides in exploring and exploiting the unknown treasures of this land. They had a large table in their preferred ~~AirBnB~~ Tavern & Inn, The Sly Prince, on which they used to carve an ever-expanding map of their expeditions. It was their terminal of sorts and their reference for all adventures. Unfortunately, it burned down during a fire)_

___
<sup>"you get a faction! and you get a faction! everyone gets a faction!"</sup>
### Factions? Factions. _(they have their own buildings)_ 
* **The Golden Legacy**: A dynasty of fancy exotic elves who "mediate and coordinate" with the leaders of all the major factions of Ingemino. [The Ivory Towers]
* **The Angelic Fighters**: The faction of holy fighters which represent their deities in Ingemino and serve The Golden Legacy without any direct communication from them. The Knights of The Arsenal are known to pick the strongest and brightest from this pool of warriors. [The Sanctus] **[Joinable]**
*  **The Council of The Eight Tipped Star**: An order of mages led by eight masters, each focused on one of the schools of magic. Almost all the mages in Ingemino are a part of this order. The Knights of The Arsenal recruit mages recommended by the arch-mages for their exemplary performance [The Octosidus] **[Joinable]**
* **The Glürgil Tinkerocracy**: This organization represents all the artisans in Ingemino. All equipment in Ingemino has either originated or been through the underground workplaces of artisans. [The Forge] **[Joinable]**
* **The Legion of The Faceless**: A nebulas organization that practices intense anonymity, enforces law and order, always wearing masks when in public settings. They take orders from The Golden Legacy.
* **The Knights of The Arsenal**: An order of highly trained and capable holy knights who directly serve and protect members of The Golden Legacy. They also stage elaborate ceremonies for bolstering the faith of the citizens in the Royal authorities.
* **The Librarians of Ingemino**:  A faction that seeks the knowledge lost to time. This faction consists of several scholars ranging from Historians to Poets.
* **The 50s**: A large group of half-breeds. Half-orcs, half-elves, half-halflings (quarterlings?). You name it. They just want to be seen as legitimate races.
* **The Order of The White Stag**: A group of rangers still loyal to the Lunelin Elven Prince, Eurylos, who was exiled almost a hundred years ago for trying to change the status quo of the way Ingemino is governed.
* **Altered Magic**: The faction of dark mages who wish to change magic forever. They were banished from Ingemino for breaking into The Octosidus _(being the only ones to ever achieve that feat yet)_ and stealing various artifacts from The Council of The Eight Tipped Star. They are not welcome in Ingemino and rumors have it they're still developing and practicing their dark magic somewhere in the world.

### RULES
* Sourcebooks allowed: PHB, XGtE and TCoE (Spells not yet reviewed). 
* Deities from the Forgotten Realms, Greek or Norse list
* Feats will be approved per case. 
* Equipment costs are written in the PHB. 
* ~~Variant Humans.~~
* Starting level = 5, Points will be rolled. You get to choose items from your starting 
  equipment list & and get starting gold as well which you have to roll for (you can spend it on 
  the PHB equipment list for the listed amount).
* Flanking: creatures on opposing sides of an enemy receive a +2 to their Attack Rolls vs the enemy between them.
* Variant Encumbrance (you don't need to pay attention to the STR column of armours): If you carry weight in excess of 5x your STR score, you are encumbered, reducing your speed by 10ft. If you carry weight in excess of 10x your STR score, you are heavily encumbered which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
* Outlander, Natural Explorer etc. give Advantage on Navigation (so that if the party moves at a fast pace, that cancels the Disadvantage), Advantage on Perception while traveling (so that if the party moves at a fast pace...), and foraging yielding enough food for a second person (basically covering one other party member’s failure) instead of the regular bonuses.
* While in combat, a potion can be consumed by a creature as a Bonus Action while "feeding" it to another creature is considered an Action. Additionally, throwing potions to others is considered an Action with a range of 20/60 feet. If the thrown potion is an attack (ie: alchemist fire, acid, etc), it is considered an Improvised Weapon.
* When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter of your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die). If you have any levels of exhaustion, the rest doesn’t reduce your exhaustion level.

**You need to be aware that the environment is not built to cater to your particular group size and you won't win all the battles you fight. TPKs, Character death, etc. are all possible IF you are careless.**

All of this is subject to change
___
#### __Exploration Roles__
 * Navigator - Wisdom (Survival): Determines the route to a chosen location, provides all players with a +2 bonus on their respective exploration role checks on a successful Skill check.
 * Scout - Dexterity (Stealth) and/or Wisdom (Perception): Moves ahead of the party, acting as a first line of defense for potential hostile encounters. Allows the party to avoid encounters on successful Skill check.
 * Lookout - Wisdom (Perception): Prevents ambushes, spots potential clues or areas of interest when party reaches their destination. Party gets advantage on Initiative rolls on a successful Skill check.
 * Forager - Intelligence (Nature): Gathers food for the party. Players don't use rations/food from inventory if anyone from the party succeeds in foraging food.
> During your travels, you may find yourselves wanting to forage for food. To forage, you must travel at a slow pace for the entire day. A character who forages successfully finds 1d6+their Wisdom modifier in pounds of food and potable water. Foraging can be abundant, moderate, scarce, or unavailable. Depending on availability, finding enough food to feed a person for a day may be more difficult.
 * Tracker - Wisdom (Survival): Identifies tracks to determine what creatures dwells in a certain areas. Party learns of any remarkable creatures that may be nearby on a successful Skill check, providing insight as to what they might face.
 * Cartographer - Dexterity (Slight of Hand) and/or Wisdom (Nature): Maps the area for the party, discovering points of interest. Players gain advantage on their exploration role checks if traveling through an area the Cartographer has previously mapped.
 * Lore Gatherer - Intelligence (History) and/or Intelligence (Nature) and/or Intelligence (Arcana): Gains insight on the area that the party is exploring. Learns lore-based information of the DM's choosing on a successful skill check.
__
#### Travel Pace (modified)
While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully (see the "Activity While Traveling" section for more information).
Pace|Distance Traveled/hour|Distance Traveled/day|Effect
 ---|        ---           |        ---          |---
Fast|          2 miles     |      15 miles       | -5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores
Normal|       1.5 miles    |      12 miles       | _
Slow|       1 mile         |      9 miles        | Able to use stealth
___
#### Forced March
The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.

For each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see the table below).
___
###### Mounts & Vehicles
For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.

Characters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel (see PHB pg155), and they don't suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.
___
##### Activity while traveling
**Encountering Creatures**: If the DM determines that the adventurers encounter other creatures while they're traveling, it's up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either group might decide to attack, initiate a conversation, offer something, run away, wait to see what the other group does etc.

**Surprising Foes**: If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group, the DM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when combat erupts. 
<sub>The DM determines who might be surprised. If neither side tries to be stealthy, they automatically notice each other. Otherwise, the DM compares the Dexterity (Stealth) checks of anyone hiding with the passive Wisdom (Perception) score of each creature on the opposing side. Any character or monster that doesn't notice a threat is surprised at the start of the encounter.</sub>

<sub>If you're surprised, you can't move or take an action on your first turn of the combat, and you can't take a reaction until that turn ends. A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.</sub>

**Navigate**: The character can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it. 

**Track**: A character can follow the tracks of another creature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it.

**Forage**: The character can keep an eye out for ready sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it.
___
#### FOOD & WATER
Characters who don't eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion. Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can't be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.
___
#### FOOD
A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 2 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.

A day spent eating twice as much food as normal reduces the counter of days went without food by 1.
___
#### WATER

A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.
___
#### Exhaustion
Level | Effect
:---: | ---
1 | Disadvantage on ability checks (not saving throws)
2 | Speed Halved
3 | Disadvantage on attack roles and saving throws
4 | Max HP halved
5 | Speed reduced to 0
6 | **DEATH**
