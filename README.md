* Sorcerers: You have an additional number of sorcery points equal to your proficiency bonus.
* When a character at 0 hit points regains hit points, they instantly become conscious and heal as per usual. However, they are still incapacitated until the end of their next turn.  
* Whenever you fail a concentration check, you gain the dazed condition until the end of your next turn. <sub>[If you are concentrating on a spell and become dazed, you lose concentration on that spell and it immediately fails. While dazed, you cannot concentrate on spells.] </sub>

### RULES
1. Sourcebooks allowed: PHB, XGtE and TCoE (Spells not yet reviewed).   
2. Deities from the Forgotten Realms, Greek or Norse list.  
3. Feats will be approved per case.   
4. Standard equipment costs are written in the PHB.   
5. Flanking: creatures on opposing sides of an enemy receive a +2 to their Attack Rolls vs the enemy between them.  
6. Conc. for holding your breath.  
7. To help another character with a skill check, you must be proficient in the skill they are using.  
8. After being reduced to 0 hit points, if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your max hit points, you gain 4 levels of exhaustion instead of instantly dying.  
9. If the party (or NPCs) want to escape combat, they can do so by having each escaping character Dash or Disengage on their next turn. Once all characters have done so, the DM (or players in the case of escaping NPCs) choose one of the following:
 * The enemy is not interested in chasing, and the escaping characters get away.
 * The enemy chases them, and a skill challenge begins. If the escapees fail the skill challenge, combat recommences with the pursuers in the beginning of initiative order. If the escapees succeed, the enemy is beaten to the objective, gives up, or loses track of the characters for at least 1d4 hours.  


All of this is subject to change

### Characteristics  

Each player character can have up to five characteristics: one personality trait, one bond, one ideal, one flaw, and a fifth characteristic of any type. These characteristics can be selected from the usual tables during character creation, but should be customized as the characters change during play.   
Any number of characteristics can be changed between sessions, to better reflect the character.  
You should be able to imagine at least one way in which each of your characteristics might come up in play. If you canâ€™t, rewrite the characteristic until you can.

### INSPIRATION! CHECK IT, SUCKAS!

#### Benefits of Inspiration
Inspiration can be used to gin one of the following benefits:
* **Your roll**: Roll an additional d20 on any roll you make. You can use this ability after the original roll, but before the outcome is revealed.
* **Your enemy's roll**: After an enemy rolls a saving throw against an effect you made, roll a d20 and choose whether an enemy uses their roll or yours.
* **_Flashback_**: You have a "flashback" to something in the past where you did something small, such as buying a healing potion or other gear, learning information, or casting a ritual spell.

#### Using Inspiration
To use inspiration, you call on one of your five personal characteristics. The characteristic should be relevant to the current situation, ideally motivating the action the character is making/taking at the time.

It's up to you how connected your chosen characteristic is to the scene - the DM won't deny you your use of Inspiration. That said, players are encouraged to portray something about their character, whether it is a silly one-liner, yelling something dramatic, or revealing something about their character's backstory or feelings.

You can only use Inspiration once per round or skill challenge.

#### Making Characteristics
When a characteristic is called on for Inspiration, put a mark next to it. It cannot be called on again until it is renewed. A maximum of three characteristics can be marked at any given time.

#### Renewing Inspiration
You can renew one of your character's characteristics in the following ways:

* **Recap**: Summarize the events of the previous session (also known as an After Action Report) either after the session ends or at the start of the next session provided nobody has done it yet. Only one player can do this per session.
* **Temptation**: If any player (including you, or the DM) notices a situation where a characteristic of your PC might make the situation more complicated, they can propose a temptation. 
If you accept the temptation, you must roleplay the characteristic in a way that complicates the situation. In exchange, you can renew any one of your characteristics.
If you propose a temptation for your own character, it is up to the DM whether to accept or refuse it. Examples of complications include insulting an important/key NPC, stealing something, or letting your curiosity, pride or honor get best of you.
* **At Death's Door**: Whenever you fail a saving throw to end being incapacitated or unconcious (for example, being stunned or at 0 hit points), you can describe a past experience "flashing before your eyes". It should be something the group does not already know, such as a moment from your backstory, and be related to the characteristic you wish to renew.
* **Growth**: If your character grows or changes through the course of play, at the end of the session you can change or replace a relevant characteristic (do inform the DM) to reflect the change. Doing so renews that characteristic. This type of renewal will occur less often than the other types.
<sub>Character growth would not happen every session, but when it does happen it can be a lot of fun. Say, a character might have an ideal, "Honour above all else!", but during the session have to sacrifice their honor in order to save their friend. Clearly honor was NOT above all else! How the player updates their character's ideal to reflect the change is how the character grows, and the player is rewarded for that growth in Inspiration and XP</sub>
