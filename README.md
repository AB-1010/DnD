_**Ingemino**_ is a moderately sized walled city attached to large body of water. You, _the Player Character_, were born and have lived your entire life in/around this city. Make your backstory whatever you like as long as it complies with the world. 
Speaking of which, The world around _Ingemino_ is almost completely unexplored apart due to the immense risk of, well, death when going out exploring for any purpose.
_(Although, there was a group of adventurers who had made great strides in exploring and exploiting the unknown treasures of this land. They had a large table in their preferred ~~AirBnB~~ Tavern & Inn, The Sly Prince, on which they used to carve an ever-expanding map of their expeditions. It was their terminal of sorts and their reference for all adventures. Unfortunately, it burned down during a fire)_

<sup>"you get a faction! and you get a faction! everyone gets a faction!"</sup>
### Factions? Factions. _(they have their own buildings)_ 
* **The Golden Legacy**: A dynasty of fancy exotic elves who "mediate and coordinate" with the leaders of all the major factions of Ingemino. [The Ivory Towers]
* **The Angelic Fighters**: The faction of holy fighters which represent their deities in Ingemino and serve The Golden Legacy without any direct communication from them. The Knights of The Arsenal are known to pick the strongest and brightest from this pool of warriors. [The Sanctus] **[Joinable]**
*  **The Council of The Eight Tipped Star**: An order of mages led by eight masters, each focused on one of the schools of magic. Almost all the mages in Ingemino are a part of this order. The Knights of The Arsenal recruit mages recommended by the arch-mages for their exemplary performance [The Octosidus] **[Joinable]**
* **The Glürgil Tinkerocracy**: This organization represents all the artisans in Ingemino. All equipment in Ingemino has either originated or been through the underground workplaces of artisans. [The Forge] **[Joinable]**
* **The Legion of The Faceless**: A nebulas organization that practices intense anonymity, enforces law and order, always wearing masks when in public settings. They take orders from The Golden Legacy.
* **The Knights of The Arsenal**: An order of highly trained and capable holy knights who directly serve and protect members of The Golden Legacy. They also stage elaborate ceremonies for bolstering the faith of the citizens in the Royal authorities.
* **The Librarians of Ingemino**:  A faction that seeks the knowledge lost to time. This faction consists of several scholars ranging from Historians to Poets.
* **The 50s**: A large group of half-breeds. Half-orcs, half-elves, half-halflings (quarterlings?). You name it. They just want to be seen as legitimate races.
* **The Order of The White Stag**: A group of rangers still loyal to the Lunelin Elven Prince, Eurylos, who was exiled almost a hundred years ago for trying to change the status quo of the way Ingemino is governed.
* **Altered Magic**: The faction of dark mages who wish to change magic forever. They were banished from Ingemino for breaking into The Octosidus _(being the only ones to ever achieve that feat yet)_ and stealing various artifacts from The Council of The Eight Tipped Star. They are not welcome in Ingemino and rumors have it they're still developing and practicing their dark magic somewhere in the world.

### RULES
1. Sourcebooks allowed: PHB, XGtE and TCoE (Spells not yet reviewed). 
2. Deities from the Forgotten Realms, Greek or Norse list
3. Feats will be approved per case. 
4. Standard equipment costs are written in the PHB. 
5. Talking does not require an action on your turn, but if you want to influence the battle, it might. Before you use your action for the turn, you can try to influence a single intelligent hostile creature that understands you. Make a contested Persuasion, Performance, Deception, Intimidation, or Animal Handling roll as normal. If the target has been harmed by the party, roll with disadvantage. If you succeed, it costs your action, and the target will offer no help but also do no harm to you until you act aggressively. If you succeed by 10 or more, the target will do what you ask as long as no risks<sup>Attacking allies carries a risk</sup> or sacrifices are involved, until you act aggressively.
6. Starting level = 5, Points will be rolled. You get to choose items from your starting 
  equipment list & and get starting gold as well which you have to roll for (you can spend it on 
  the PHB equipment list for the listed amount).
7. Flanking: creatures on opposing sides of an enemy receive a +2 to their Attack Rolls vs the enemy between them.
8. Variant Encumbrance (you don't need to pay attention to the STR column of armours): If you carry weight in excess of 5x your STR score, you are encumbered, reducing your speed by 10ft. If you carry weight in excess of 10x your STR score, you are heavily encumbered which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
9. (To be changed) Outlander, Natural Explorer etc. give Advantage on Navigation (so that if the party moves at a fast pace, that cancels the Disadvantage), Advantage on Perception while traveling (so that if the party moves at a fast pace...), and foraging yielding enough food for a second person (basically covering one other party member’s failure) instead of the regular bonuses.
10. While in combat, a potion can be consumed by a creature as a Bonus Action while "feeding" it to another creature is considered an Action. Additionally, throwing potions to others is considered an Action with a range of 20/60 feet. If the thrown potion is an attack (ie: alchemist fire, acid, etc), it is considered an Improvised Weapon.
11. When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter of your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die). If you have any levels of exhaustion, the rest doesn’t reduce your exhaustion level.
12. To help another character with a skill check, you must be proficient in the skill they are using.
13. After being reduced to 0 hit points, if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your max hit points, you gain 4 levels of exhaustion instead of instantly dying.
14. If the party (or NPCs) want to escape combat, they can do so by having each escaping character Dash or Disengage on their next turn. Once all characters have done so, the DM (or players in the case of escaping NPCs) choose one of the following:
 * The enemy is not interested in chasing, and the escaping characters get away.
 * The enemy chases them, and a skill challenge begins. If the escapees fail the skill challenge, combat recommences with the pursuers in the beginning of initiative order. If the escapees succeed, the enemy is beaten to the objective, gives up, or loses track of the characters for at least 1d4 hours.
15. You need to maintain concentration to hold your breath.
---
**You need to be aware that the environment is not built to cater to your particular group size and you won't win all the battles you fight. TPKs, Character death, etc. are all possible IF you are careless.**

All of this is subject to change

### Scribing Spell Scrolls  

Scribing a spell scroll takes an amount of time and money related to the level of the spell the character wants to scribe, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. In addition, the character must have proficiency in the Arcana skill and must provide any material components required for the casting of the spell. Moreover, the character must have the spell prepared, or it must be among the character's known spells, in order to scribe a scroll of that spell.  

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were 1st level.  
#### Spell Scroll Costs  
Spell Level	| Time	| Cost | Flux
:---:|:---|---:|---:
Cantrip |	1 day |	15 gp | 0
1st	| 1 day	| 25 gp | 1
2nd	| 3 days	| 250 gp | 5
3rd	| 1 workweek |	500 gp | 8
4th	| 2 workweeks	| 2,500 gp | 24
5th	| 4 workweeks	| 5,000 gp | 36
6th	| 8 workweeks	| 15,000 gp | 72
7th	| 16 workweeks	| 25,000 gp | 96

:---: | ---
1 | Disadvantage on ability checks (not saving throws)
2 | Speed Halved
3 | Disadvantage on attack roles and saving throws
4 | Max HP halved
5 | Speed reduced to 0
6 | **DEATH**
___

#### "Active" Ability Checks  
When the DM proposes an ability or skill check, they choose a DC based on how the players have described their characters performing the task.
The DM tells the players the DC before any dice are rolled – the characters are assumed to be competent enough to assess the difficulty of a task before they attempt it.  
The players then have the option to either attempt the ability check, or decide on a different course of action. This can include altering how they approach the task in order to make it easier, in which case the DM would be open to lowering the DC. Or if the solution is clever enough, an ability check might not be necessary at all! This can be particularly appropriate when navigating hazards.  
<sub>Ability checks are more than just dice rolls. Ability checks are an opportunity for roleplaying. Describing how a character does something can often be more interesting than the dice roll itself.</sub>

___
### Characteristics  

Each player character can have up to five characteristics: one personality trait, one bond, one ideal, one flaw, and a fifth characteristic of any type. These characteristics can be selected from the usual tables during character creation, but should be customized as the characters change during play.   
Any number of characteristics can be changed between sessions, to better reflect the character.  
You should be able to imagine at least one way in which each of your characteristics might come up in play. If you can’t, rewrite the characteristic until you can.
___
### INSPIRATION! CHECK IT, SUCKAS!

#### Benefits of Inspiration
Inspiration can be used to gin one of the following benefits:
* **Your roll**: Roll an additional d20 on any roll you make. You can use this ability after the original roll, but before the outcome is revealed.
* **Your enemy's roll**: After an enemy rolls a saving throw against an effect you made, roll a d20 and choose whether an enemy uses their roll or yours.
* **_Flashback_**: You have a "flashback" to something in the past where you did something small, such as buying a healing potion or other gear, learning information, or casting a ritual spell.

#### Using Inspiration
To use inspiration, you call on one of your five personal characteristics. The characteristic should be relevant to the current situation, ideally motivating the action the character is making/taking at the time.

It's up to you how connected your chosen characteristic is to the scene - the DM won't deny you your use of Inspiration. That said, players are encouraged to portray something about their character, whether it is a silly one-liner, yelling something dramatic, or revealing something about their character's backstory or feelings.

You can only use Inspiration once per round or skill challenge.

#### Making Characteristics
When a characteristic is called on for Inspiration, put a mark next to it. It cannot be called on again until it is renewed. A maximum of three characteristics can be marked at any given time.

#### Renewing Inspiration
You can renew one of your character's characteristics in the following ways:

* **Recap**: Summarize the events of the previous session (also known as an After Action Report) either after the session ends or at the start of the next session provided nobody has done it yet. Only one player can do this per session.
* **Temptation**: If any player (including you, or the DM) notices a situation where a characteristic of your PC might make the situation more complicated, they can propose a temptation. 
If you accept the temptation, you must roleplay the characteristic in a way that complicates the situation. In exchange, you can renew any one of your characteristics.
If you propose a temptation for your own character, it is up to the DM whether to accept or refuse it. Examples of complications include insulting an important/key NPC, stealing something, or letting your curiosity, pride or honor get best of you.
* **At Death's Door**: Whenever you fail a saving throw to end being incapacitated or unconcious (for example, being stunned or at 0 hit points), you can describe a past experience "flashing before your eyes". It should be something the group does not already know, such as a moment from your backstory, and be related to the characteristic you wish to renew.
* **Growth**: If your character grows or changes through the course of play, at the end of the session you can change or replace a relevant characteristic (do inform the DM) to reflect the change. Doing so renews that characteristic. This type of renewal will occur less often than the other types.
<sub>Character growth would not happen every session, but when it does happen it can be a lot of fun. Say, a character might have an ideal, "Honour above all else!", but during the session have to sacrifice their honor in order to save their friend. Clearly honor was NOT above all else! How the player updates their character's ideal to reflect the change is how the character grows, and the player is rewarded for that growth in Inspiration and XP</sub>

___
#### Called Shots
When plausible in the fiction of battle, you can make a "called shot", where you attack a specific part of a creature, or an object the creature is holding or wearing. The DM decides what the effect will be for succeeding before you commit to making a called shot. Examples of appropriate effects are included in the examples table.

Making a called shot **requires having advantage** on the attack, and the cost of making a called shot is that you **lose advantage**. If the attack hits, the called shot is successful: you deal damage as normal, and the target suffers from the effect.

You can make up to one called shot per round. Creatures can only be affected by one called shot at a time. NPCs can also make called shots.   
**Effect Duration**: Bodily injuries should be temporary, lasting until the end of your next turn. An example, shooting a Cyclops's eye only bruises it for a round, instead of permanently blinding them. Other effects, such as disarming them, last until voluntarily fixed.  
__Examples__
Too Weak | Appropriate | Too Strong
---|---|---
-10 ft speed | Loses flying speed | Paralyzed
-4 on next attack | Blinded | Stunned 
Disadv. on a skill | Disadv. on a saving throw (incl. concentration) | Disadv. on multiple saving throws
-4 damage | Diarmed | Halved damage
