__Players:__  
* Make their death saving throws in secret    
* Instead of sharing the HP they have with others, say they are "Beat up", "Bruised" or a similar term for 50% HP Remaining; say they are "Bloodied" when only a quarter of their HP remains.  
* Please distribute the treasure amongst yourselves as you see fit. I am not here to enforce socialism.  
* I am trusting you to record your earnings and spendings accurately, as well as to not be dishonest about your rolls.  
* Ask/Say what you would like to do but please do not make rolls for things if not asked for it, or assume you have advantage or disadvantage on a roll.  
* _It might be hard to believe, but I am actually on your side! Shocking, right?_  
* Talk to me about anything you want to take from books other than the PHB (Spells, Races, Classes, etc.). Reminder: things outside the PHB are always "optional".


__Characters:__  
* No evil alignment allowed.  
* Begin at level 1.  
* Ability scores (re-rolled if all <15) and HP (re-roll if 1) are rolled.
* Race and classes are available from PHB. TCoE has been added to the list of potential options <sub>(courtesy of OxyMagnesium and Kami Sama)</sub> for the time being, but will soon include possible options from the XGtE as well.
* Take starting equipment.
