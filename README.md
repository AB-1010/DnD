_**Ingemino**_ is a moderately sized walled city on the coast of a large body of water. You, _the Player Character_, were born and have lived your entire life in this city. Make your backstory whatever you like as long as it complies with the world. 
Speaking of which, The world around _Ingemino_ is almost completely unexplored apart due to the immense risk of, well, death when going out exploring for any purpose.
_(Although, there was a group of adventurers who had made great strides in exploring and exploiting the unknown treasures of this land. They had a large table in their preferred ~~AirBnB~~ Tavern & Inn, The Sly Prince, on which they used to carve an ever-expanding map of their expeditions. It was their terminal of sorts and their reference for all adventures. Unfortunately, it burned down during a fire)_

{/|_"**you** get a faction! and **you** get a faction! **everyone** gets a faction!"_}
### Factions? Factions. _(they have their own buildings)_ 
* **The Golden Legacy**: A dynasty of fancy exotic elves who "mediate and coordinate" with the leaders of all the major factions of Ingemino. [The Ivory Towers]
* **The Angelic Fighters**: The faction of holy fighters which represent their deities in Ingemino and serve The Golden Legacy without any direct communication from them. The Knights of The Arsenal are known to pick the strongest and brightest from this pool of warriors. [The Sanctus] **[Joinable]**
*  **The Council of The Eight Tipped Star**: An order of mages led by eight masters, each focused on one of the schools of magic. Almost all the mages in Ingemino are a part of this order. The Knights of The Arsenal recruit mages recommended by the arch-mages for their exemplary performance [The Octosidus] **[Joinable]**
* **The Gl√ºrgil Tinkerocracy**: This organization represents all the artisans in Ingemino. All equipment in Ingemino has either originated or been through the underground workplaces of artisans. [The Forge] **[Joinable]**
* **The Legion of The Faceless**: A nebulas organization that practices intense anonymity, enforces law and order, always wearing masks when in public settings. They take orders from The Golden Legacy.
* **The Knights of The Arsenal**: An order of highly trained and capable holy knights who directly serve and protect members of The Golden Legacy. They also stage elaborate ceremonies for the bolstering the faith of the citizens in the Royal authorities.
* **The Librarians of Ingemino**:  A faction that seeks the knowledge lost to time. This faction consists of several scholars ranging from Historians to Poets.
* **The 50s**: A large group of half-breeds. Half-orcs, half-elves, half-halflings (quarterlings?). You name it. They just want to be seen as legitimate races.
* **The Order of The White Stag**: A group of rangers still loyal to the Lunelin Elven Prince, Eurylos, who was exiled almost a hundred years ago for trying to change the status quo of the way Ingemino is governed.
* **Altered Magic**: The faction of dark mages who wish to change magic forever. They were banished from Ingemino for breaking into The Octosidus _(being the only ones to ever achieve that feat yet)_ and stealing various artifacts from The Council of The Eight Tipped Star. They are not welcome in Ingemino and rumors have it they're still developing and practicing their dark magic somewhere in the world.
