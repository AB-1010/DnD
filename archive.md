## EXPLORATION 
<sup>this is a big one</sup>

#### Time 
Travel is tracked in days and hexes. One set of rolls is made per day, and a number of hexes will be traversed per day depending on the environment, the mode of travel, and whether the party pushes themselves.
____
#### Sleeping In The Wild  
**TL;DR** You do not get the benefits of long rests in the wild and you expend 1 Hit Die/"Long Rest". If you run out of Hit Dice, you gain 1 level of exhaustion.  

Whenever you sleep in the wilderness, you cannot benefit from a long rest and you expend one Hit Die. This includes somewhere temporary like a cave or tent, or other squalid condition.  
Long rests require at least poor conditions: safe and comfortable places like a wizard's tower, a permanent and maintained tree-house, or a secure room safe from the weather and wandering monsters.  
If you have no remaining Hit Dice, you instead gain a level of exhaustion. While there are ways to mitigate it, Hit Dice and exhaustion are the main time-tracking mechanisms, incentivizing the party to spend as little possible time between safe locations.  
If you live a wealthy lifestyle (get an upgraded room for 4gp/day at The Sly Prince) or higher for the duration of a long rest, you recover one additional level of exhaustion.
___
#### Travel Procedure
**_For Known regions_**  
Each day the party travels through a region, perform the following steps:  
* **Step 1**: Every day, the players choose the hexes they want to travel through within 8 hours, or alternatively have at least one Player Character **search** for a known location or creature and let the DM choose the hex(es) based on whether the search succeeds or not.  
* **Step 2**: Every 4 days, each PC chooses one of the following activities to perform while traveling: **navigate, search, forage, on watch, support, utilize vehicle, motivate, chronicle, or craft**  
* **Step 3**: While the players are choosing their activities, the DM rolls on an encounter table and prepares the encounter. If it is an Environment Hazard, introduces it after the players have picked their activities but before DCs are determined.  
* **Step 4**: The PC's resolve their activities, and roleplay any scenes they would like to have.  
* **Step 5**: Every 4 days, if an encounter was rolled and it was not an evironmental hazard, the DM introduces it.  
* **Step 6**: Every day, the players choose whether to do a forced march, and which additional hexes they will travel through.  

__Hours per hex__
Environment | On Foot | Vehicle
---|:---:|:---:|
Road/Path, Grassland, Coastal, Desert, Arctic, Underdark | 8 | 4
Swamp, Hills | 12 | 8
Forest, Mountain (path) | 16 | 12
Mountains | 32 | 24
Water | 32 | 8
Air | No | Go away

**_For unknown regions, AKA Exploring_**  
* **Step 1**: Every day, the players choose the hex they want to travel through within 8 hours, or alternatively have at least one Player Character **search** for a known location or creature and let the DM choose the neighboring hex based on whether the search succeeds or not.  
* **Step 2**: Every 4 days, DM determines encounters  
* **Step 3**: If a non-hazardous problem is encountered, the DM introduces it.  
* **Step 4**: The players choose whether to do a forced march, and which additional hex they will travel through.  
_Once the party decides not to travel any further that day:_  
* **_Step 5_**: Every 4 days, each PC chooses one of the following activities to perform: **navigate, search, forage, on watch, support, utilize vehicle, motivate, chronicle, or craft**  
* **_Step 6_**: The PCs resolve their activities, and roleplay any scenes they would like to have.  
___
The party can always see if neighboring hexes are mountains.  
___
#### Travel Distance  
The party can reasonably travel for 8 hours each day. The number of hexes that can be traversed depends on the environment, as shown in the Hours per hex table. These numbers assume that the party possesses any appropriate gear, such as snow shoes or mountaineering equipment.  
**_Vehicles & Mounts_**: Mounts (or a vehicle) might allow the part to traverse more hexes in a day. Not all vehicles are applicable in all environments however. As an example, carriages are likely only usable on roads, and most vehicles will not be any faster than walking in forests or mountains.  
**_Forced March_**: If the party wants to traverse more hexes, they can travel for up to 16 hours in a single day, instead of the normal 8. Each additional hour risks [exhaustion](https://github.com/AB-1010/DnD/#exhaustion) and a DC 10 + 1 for each hour CON Save must be made at the end of the hour.  
**_Stealth_** Traveling undetected relies on spotting threats before they spot you. See the **On Watch** activity, described later.  
**_Rotating Shifts_**: If the party is traveling on a vehicle large enough for them to rest, and the creatures operating the vehicle (such as horses, oarsmen, boiler room workers, or captain) can change at least every 8 hours, the party can travel for 24 hours a day.

### Travel Activities  
This section outlines the activities that a character can perform while traveling.

Each character can perform one activity per day.  
**_Rangers_**: Rangers can perform two activities per day.  
**_Outlander Background_**: The Wanderer feature is replaced with the following  
> In addition to your normal choice of activity when traveling, you can perform the Navigate or Forage activity.

**_DC's_**: I am just going to put them in a table in the end so that everyone knows them and doesn't need to keep asking me. Just take the Activity DC and add the DC Modifiers.  
**_Multiple environments_**: All activities and encounters occur in the most common environment traveled through that day.  
**_Multiple characters_**: If multiple characters perform the same activity, each character rolls as normal and only the highest result is used.  

#### Navigate  
You navigate the wilderness, aiming to keep track of where you are and not get lost. _Can you not metagame if you do get lost?_  
The DC is determined by the environment the party is traveling through and any relevant modifiers, as described in the Activity DC tables.   
On a success, the party follows the planned route. On a failure, the party is lost.  
If the DC is 0 or less, the party cannot get lost (and therefore does not require a navigator)  
**_Proficiencies_**: Wisdom (Survival), Intelligence (Navigator's Tools).  
**_Being Lost_**: If the party becomes lost, The DM tells the party what environment they are in and describes and landmarks in the hex, but does not give them any more information than that. It is up to the party to solve their predicament!  

#### Forage  
You forage for food and water. The DC is determined by the environment the party is in and any relevant modifiers, as described in the Activity DC tables.  
On a success, you find enough food and water to feed the PCs for the day. If you beat the DC by more than 10, you also find enough for the PCs' mounts and close companions. Each unfed creature consumes 5sp/2 lbs of rations for the day or loses 1 Hit Die. If they have no remaining Hit Dice, or do not eat or drink for a number of days equal to their Constitution modifier, they gain a level of exhaustion.  
**_Proficiencies_**: Int or Wis (Survival or Nature)  
I will assume if the party is traveling with a vehicle or mount, they are carrying a barrel containing a week's worth of water.  
Magic below 3rd level cannot provide hydration.  

#### Search  
You are tracking a creature or searching for something. Regardless of what you are searching for, calculate the DC (you know the process by now). On a success, choose one of the following:  
* You find what you are looking for, if the DM knows it is in the hexes you traveled through.  
* Roll d10+10, and choose whether to replace the DM's Encounter roll for the day with the new roll (you will not know what was previously rolled). If an Environment Hazard has already been introduced, the roll would be in addition the the Hazard, instead of replacing it.  
**_Proficiencies_**: Int or Wis (Survival, Investigation, or Perception)  

#### Support  
You help the party handle the wilderness with supporting tasks like preparing meals or alcohol, tending to injuries, or repairing shoes or gear.   
The DC is 10 + the average party level. On a success, the party does not lose a Hit Die for sleeping in the wild that day, and other party members can add a d4 to their Activity checks.  
**_Proficiencies_**: Intelligence or Wisdom (Medicine, Cook’s Utensils or Brewer’s Supplies), Intelligence or Strength (Cobbler’s Tools), Intelligence or Dexterity (Weaver’s Tools).  

#### Motivate  
You motivate the party to keep the pace up by playing music, coaching, persuading or intimidating the party.  
The DC is 10 + the average party level. On a success, the first 3 hours of a forced march that day don’t risk [Exhaustion](https://github.com/AB-1010/DnD/#exhaustion), and players can add a d4 to any initiative checks that day.  
**_Proficiencies_**: Charisma (Persuasion), Strength or Charisma (Intimidate or Athletics), Wisdom or Charisma (Musical Instrument).  

#### On Watch  
You vigilantly keep a look out for creatures and hazards. If other creatures are also on watch, spotting them before they spot the party requires a succeeding at a contested Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise you always spot them first. Seeing creatures early allows the party to avoid them using normal stealth rules, if desired.  
You also have a chance to spot some Environment Hazards more quickly, using the environment’s Search DC.    
**_Proficiencies_**: Wisdom (Perception).  

#### Utilize Vehicle  
Whether its skillful control, tender caring of animals, or clever adjustments, vehicles and mounts can be pushed to travel faster.  
The DC to utilize a vehicle (or mount) in this way is determined by the environment the party is in and any relevant modifiers, as described in the Activity DC tables. On a success, the first 3 hours of a forced march that day don’t cost Hit Dice, and you have advantage on any checks or saving throws made to control the vehicle (or mount).    
**_Proficiencies_**: Dexterity, Intelligence or Wisdom (Vehicle (Land or Water)), Wisdom (Animal Handling), Strength or Intelligence (Carpenter’s, Smith’s, or Tinker’s tools).  

#### Chronicle  
You chronicle the party’s journey, creating a record such as drawings, songs, poems, a journal, or maps. Any chronicle you create has a set amount of value, either in gold pieces or services. For example you could recount the chronicle at taverns for free food and beds, or sell copies of the work to a library or guild.  
Roll an ability check with one of the skills or toolkits below that you are proficient with. The chronicle has a gp value equal to half the result (rounded up). The value is doubled if you discover a new location or creature in the area.  
If you roll above the environment’s navigation DC, the party can travel the same route without making a navigation check in future. This includes backtracking if you become lost.  
**_Proficiencies_**: Intelligence (History, Performance, Musical Instrument, Forgery kit or Cartographer’s tools), Intelligence or Dexterity (Calligrapher’s or Painter’s supplies).  

#### Craft (Multiple)  
Each day, you gather materials from the environment and craft one of the following, depending on the toolkit you use. The DCs are presented in the Activity DC table.  
* **_Magic Ink_**: You find a faintly magical liquid in a plant or carcass, and either scribe a cantrip or 1st level spell you know, or create a letter or artwork that causes the first viewer to be under the effect of the Suggestion spell. Roll Intelligence or Wisdom (Forgery kit, Painter’s or Calligrapher’s supplies, Cartographer’s tools).
* **_Poison_**: You find ingredients and create a mild poison. It is an ingestion or injury poison, and causes the target to become poisoned for an hour if they fail a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw. Roll Intelligence or Wisdom (Brewer’s or Alchemist’s supplies, Cook’s utensils, Herbalism or Poisoner’s kit).
* **_Potion of Healing_**: You find ingredients and create a potion of healing. Roll Intelligence or Wisdom (Herbalism or Poisoner’s kit, or Alchemist’s supplies).
* **_Sharpened Weapon_**: You find strange wood, a high-quality whetstone, or something similarly appropriate. With the materials you craft or sharpen a weapon. It deals +5 damage the first time it hits. Roll Dexterity or Wisdom (Mason’s, Smith’s, Tinker’s, Jeweler’s, Woodcarver’s or Carpenter’s tools).
* **_Special material_**: At the DM’s discretion, you can also gather materials to craft other things, though some may take longer than a day to make or require more materials.
* **_Temporary Protection_**: You find materials and craft a makeshift piece of protective equipment. It provides +2 AC for up to 7 days until it prevents an attack that would otherwise hit the wearer. Roll Strength or Wisdom (Woodcarver’s, Carpenter’s, Leatherworker’s, Cobbler’s, Potter’s or Weaver’s tools).
___
### Downtime
#### Travelling  
Player characters can travel for 8 hours a day during downtime without risking random encounters or attempting activities. However unless they are travelling on a road (or aboard a passenger ship), they can only travel through hexes they have previously travelled through.

#### Activities 
With a week of downtime, a PC can successfully complete one of the following Activities without risk (assuming they meet any proficiency requirements):

*   Search the area, at the DM’s discretion. 
*   Chronicle the goings-on in the area for a week.   
*   Craft one of the listed items. Special materials are still at the DM’s discretion.  
____
#### Crafting Magic Items  
To craft magical items, one needs a special resource known as **_Flux_** and the required materials worth in gold.  
Flux is made of a jagged, shimmering crystal material that slowly changes color over time. It is considered magical, and emanates turbulent magical energy. One piece of flux can fit in the palm of a human hand, and weighs 1 lb. Flux is too unreliable to be part of a larger economy.  

__Disenchanting__  
To disenchant a magic item, it takes half the time it would take to craft the item, and results in the creation of half as many flux pieces as it would take to craft the item. The item is destroyed in the process. It does not require any gold to disenchant a magic item. If a magic item has a limited number of charges and cannot be recharged, the number of flux pieces created from disenchanting it is reduced proportionally. Flux cannot be used to craft potions or scrolls, nor can they be disenchanted.
___
___
### Scribing Spell Scrolls  

Scribing a spell scroll takes an amount of time and money related to the level of the spell the character wants to scribe, as shown in the Spell Scroll Costs table. In addition, the character must have proficiency in the Arcana skill and must provide any material components required for the casting of the spell. Moreover, the character must have the spell prepared, or it must be among the character's known spells, in order to scribe a scroll of that spell.  

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were 1st level.  
#### Spell Scroll Costs  
Spell Level	| Time	| Cost | Flux
:---:|:---|---:|---:
Cantrip |	1 day |	15 gp | 0
1st	| 1 day	| 25 gp | 1
2nd	| 3 days	| 250 gp | 5
3rd	| 1 workweek |	500 gp | 8
4th	| 2 workweeks	| 2,500 gp | 24
5th	| 4 workweeks	| 5,000 gp | 36
6th	| 8 workweeks	| 15,000 gp | 72
7th	| 16 workweeks	| 25,000 gp | 96
8th	| 32 workweeks	| 50,000 gp | 144
9th	| 48 workweeks	| 250,000 gp | 360

___
<sup>"you get a faction! and you get a faction! everyone gets a faction!"</sup>
### Factions? Factions. _(they have their own buildings)_ 
* **The Golden Legacy**: A dynasty of fancy exotic elves who "mediate and coordinate" with the leaders of all the major factions of Ingemino. [The Ivory Towers]
* **The Angelic Fighters**: The faction of holy fighters which represent their deities in Ingemino and serve The Golden Legacy without any direct communication from them. The Knights of The Arsenal are known to pick the strongest and brightest from this pool of warriors. [The Sanctus] **[Joinable]**
*  **The Council of The Eight Tipped Star**: An order of mages led by eight masters, each focused on one of the schools of magic. Almost all the mages in Ingemino are a part of this order. The Knights of The Arsenal recruit mages recommended by the arch-mages for their exemplary performance [The Octosidus] **[Joinable]**
* **The Glürgil Tinkerocracy**: This organization represents all the artisans in Ingemino. All equipment in Ingemino has either originated or been through the underground workplaces of artisans. [The Forge] **[Joinable]**
* **The Legion of The Faceless**: A nebulas organization that practices intense anonymity, enforces law and order, always wearing masks when in public settings. They take orders from The Golden Legacy.
* **The Knights of The Arsenal**: An order of highly trained and capable holy knights who directly serve and protect members of The Golden Legacy. They also stage elaborate ceremonies for bolstering the faith of the citizens in the Royal authorities.
* **The Librarians of Ingemino**:  A faction that seeks the knowledge lost to time. This faction consists of several scholars ranging from Historians to Poets.
* **The 50s**: A large group of half-breeds. Half-orcs, half-elves, half-halflings (quarterlings?). You name it. They just want to be seen as legitimate races.
* **The Order of The White Stag**: A group of rangers still loyal to the Lunelin Elven Prince, Eurylos, who was exiled almost a hundred years ago for trying to change the status quo of the way Ingemino is governed.
* **Altered Magic**: The faction of dark mages who wish to change magic forever. They were banished from Ingemino for breaking into The Octosidus _(being the only ones to ever achieve that feat yet)_ and stealing various artifacts from The Council of The Eight Tipped Star. They are not welcome in Ingemino and rumors have it they're still developing and practicing their dark magic somewhere in the world.
