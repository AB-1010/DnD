___
_**Ingemino**_ is a moderately sized walled city on the coast of a large body of water. You, _the Player Character_, were born and have lived your entire life in this city. Make your backstory whatever you like as long as it complies with the world. 
Speaking of which, The world around _Ingemino_ is almost completely unexplored apart due to the immense risk of, well, death when going out exploring for any purpose.
_(Although, there was a group of adventurers who had made great strides in exploring and exploiting the unknown treasures of this land. They had a large table in their preferred ~~AirBnB~~ Tavern & Inn, The Sly Prince, on which they used to carve an ever-expanding map of their expeditions. It was their terminal of sorts and their reference for all adventures. Unfortunately, it burned down during a fire)_

There is no particular source of light (as in, there's no visible "sun" in the sky) in the day, the entire sky seems to light up. Two moons can be seen in clear night skies. They are called "Alpha" and "Beta".
___
<sup>"you get a faction! and you get a faction! everyone gets a faction!"</sup>
### Factions? Factions. _(they have their own buildings)_ 
* **The Golden Legacy**: A dynasty of fancy exotic elves who "mediate and coordinate" with the leaders of all the major factions of Ingemino. [The Ivory Towers]
* **The Angelic Fighters**: The faction of holy fighters which represent their deities in Ingemino and serve The Golden Legacy without any direct communication from them. The Knights of The Arsenal are known to pick the strongest and brightest from this pool of warriors. [The Sanctus] **[Joinable]**
*  **The Council of The Eight Tipped Star**: An order of mages led by eight masters, each focused on one of the schools of magic. Almost all the mages in Ingemino are a part of this order. The Knights of The Arsenal recruit mages recommended by the arch-mages for their exemplary performance [The Octosidus] **[Joinable]**
* **The Glürgil Tinkerocracy**: This organization represents all the artisans in Ingemino. All equipment in Ingemino has either originated or been through the underground workplaces of artisans. [The Forge] **[Joinable]**
* **The Legion of The Faceless**: A nebulas organization that practices intense anonymity, enforces law and order, always wearing masks when in public settings. They take orders from The Golden Legacy.
* **The Knights of The Arsenal**: An order of highly trained and capable holy knights who directly serve and protect members of The Golden Legacy. They also stage elaborate ceremonies for bolstering the faith of the citizens in the Royal authorities.
* **The Librarians of Ingemino**:  A faction that seeks the knowledge lost to time. This faction consists of several scholars ranging from Historians to Poets.
* **The 50s**: A large group of half-breeds. Half-orcs, half-elves, half-halflings (quarterlings?). You name it. They just want to be seen as legitimate races.
* **The Order of The White Stag**: A group of rangers still loyal to the Lunelin Elven Prince, Eurylos, who was exiled almost a hundred years ago for trying to change the status quo of the way Ingemino is governed.
* **Altered Magic**: The faction of dark mages who wish to change magic forever. They were banished from Ingemino for breaking into The Octosidus _(being the only ones to ever achieve that feat yet)_ and stealing various artifacts from The Council of The Eight Tipped Star. They are not welcome in Ingemino and rumors have it they're still developing and practicing their dark magic somewhere in the world.
___
### RULES
1. Sourcebooks allowed: PHB, XGtE and TCoE (Spells not yet reviewed). 
2. Deities from the Forgotten Realms, Greek or Norse list
3. Feats will be approved per case. 
4. Equipment costs are written in the PHB. 
5. Talking does not require an action on your turn, but if you want to influence the battle, it might. Before you use your action for the turn, you can try to influence a single intelligent hostile creature that understands you. Make a contested Persuasion, Performance, Deception, Intimidation, or Animal Handling roll as normal. If the target has been harmed by the party, roll with disadvantage. If you succeed, it costs your action, and the target will offer no help but also do no harm to you until you act aggressively. If you succeed by 10 or more, the target will do what you ask as long as no risks<sup>Attacking allies carries a risk</sup> or sacrifices are involved, until you act aggressively.
6. Starting level = 5, Points will be rolled. You get to choose items from your starting 
  equipment list & and get starting gold as well which you have to roll for (you can spend it on 
  the PHB equipment list for the listed amount).
7. Flanking: creatures on opposing sides of an enemy receive a +2 to their Attack Rolls vs the enemy between them.
8. Variant Encumbrance (you don't need to pay attention to the STR column of armours): If you carry weight in excess of 5x your STR score, you are encumbered, reducing your speed by 10ft. If you carry weight in excess of 10x your STR score, you are heavily encumbered which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.
9. (To be changed) Outlander, Natural Explorer etc. give Advantage on Navigation (so that if the party moves at a fast pace, that cancels the Disadvantage), Advantage on Perception while traveling (so that if the party moves at a fast pace...), and foraging yielding enough food for a second person (basically covering one other party member’s failure) instead of the regular bonuses.
10. While in combat, a potion can be consumed by a creature as a Bonus Action while "feeding" it to another creature is considered an Action. Additionally, throwing potions to others is considered an Action with a range of 20/60 feet. If the thrown potion is an attack (ie: alchemist fire, acid, etc), it is considered an Improvised Weapon.
11. When you finish a long rest during which you slept in medium or heavy armor, you regain only one quarter of your spent Hit Dice (minimum of one die). If you have any levels of exhaustion, the rest doesn’t reduce your exhaustion level.
12. To help another character with a skill check, you must be proficient in the skill they are using.
13. After being reduced to 0 hit points, if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your max hit points, you gain 4 levels of exhaustion instead of instantly dying.
14. If the party (or NPCs) want to escape combat, they can do so by having each escaping character Dash or Disengage on their next turn. Once all characters have done so, the DM (or players in the case of escaping NPCs) choose one of the following:
 * The enemy is not interested in chasing, and the escaping characters get away.
 * The enemy chases them, and a skill challenge begins. If the escapees fail the skill challenge, combat recommences with the pursuers in the beginning of initiative order. If the escapees succeed, the enemy is beaten to the objective, gives up, or loses track of the characters for at least 1d4 hours.
15. You need to maintain concentration to hold your breath.
---
**You need to be aware that the environment is not built to cater to your particular group size and you won't win all the battles you fight. TPKs, Character death, etc. are all possible IF you are careless.**

All of this is subject to change
___
____
## EXPLORATION 
<sup>this is a big one</sup>

#### Time 
Travel is tracked in days and hexes. One set of rolls is made per day, and a number of hexes will be traversed per day depending on the environment, the mode of travel, and whether the party pushes themselves.
____
#### Sleeping In The Wild  
**TL;DR** You do not get the benefits of long rests in the wild and you expend 1 Hit Die/"Long Rest". If you run out of Hit Dice, you gain 1 level of exhaustion.  

Whenever you sleep in the wilderness, you cannot benefit from a long rest and you expend one Hit Die. This includes somewhere temporary like a cave or tent, or other squalid condition.  
Long rests require at least poor conditions: safe and comfortable places like a wizard's tower, a permanent and maintained tree-house, or a secure room safe from the weather and wandering monsters.  
If you have no remaining Hit Dice, you instead gain a level of exhaustion. While there are ways to mitigate it, Hit Dice and exhaustion are the main time-tracking mechanisms, incentivizing the party to spend as little possible time between safe locations.  
If you live a wealthy lifestyle (get an upgraded room for 4gp/day at The Sly Prince) or higher for the duration of a long rest, you recover one additional level of exhaustion.
___
#### Travel Procedure
**_For Known regions_**  
Each day the party travels through a region, perform the following steps:  
* **Step 1**: Every day, the players choose the hexes they want to travel through within 8 hours, or alternatively have at least one Player Character **search** for a known location or creature and let the DM choose the hex(es) based on whether the search succeeds or not.  
* **Step 2**: Every 4 days, each PC chooses one of the following activities to perform while traveling: **navigate, search, forage, on watch, support, utilize vehicle, motivate, chronicle, or craft**  
* **Step 3**: While the players are choosing their activities, the DM rolls on an encounter table and prepares the encounter. If it is an Environment Hazard, introduces it after the players have picked their activities but before DCs are determined.  
* **Step 4**: The PC's resolve their activities, and roleplay any scenes they would like to have.  
* **Step 5**: Every 4 days, if an encounter was rolled and it was not an evironmental hazard, the DM introduces it.  
* **Step 6**: Every day, the players choose whether to do a forced march, and which additional hexes they will travel through.  

__Hours per hex__
Environment | On Foot | Vehicle
---|:---:|:---:|
Road/Path, Grassland, Coastal, Desert, Arctic, Underdark | 8 | 4
Swamp, Hills | 12 | 8
Forest, Mountain (path) | 16 | 12
Mountains | 32 | 24
Water | 32 | 8
Air | No | Go away

**_For unknown regions, AKA Exploring_**  
* **Step 1**: Every day, the players choose the hex they want to travel through within 8 hours, or alternatively have at least one Player Character **search** for a known location or creature and let the DM choose the neighboring hex based on whether the search succeeds or not.  
* **Step 2**: Every 4 days, DM determines encounters  
* **Step 3**: If a non-hazardous problem is encountered, the DM introduces it.  
* **Step 4**: The players choose whether to do a forced march, and which additional hex they will travel through.  
_Once the party decides not to travel any further that day:_  
* **_Step 5_**: Every 4 days, each PC chooses one of the following activities to perform: **navigate, search, forage, on watch, support, utilize vehicle, motivate, chronicle, or craft**  
* **_Step 6_**: The PCs resolve their activities, and roleplay any scenes they would like to have.  
___
The party can always see if neighboring hexes are mountains.  
___
#### Travel Distance  
The party can reasonably travel for 8 hours each day. The number of hexes that can be traversed depends on the environment, as shown in the Hours per hex table. These numbers assume that the party possesses any appropriate gear, such as snow shoes or mountaineering equipment.  
**_Vehicles & Mounts_**: Mounts (or a vehicle) might allow the part to traverse more hexes in a day. Not all vehicles are applicable in all environments however. As an example, carriages are likely only usable on roads, and most vehicles will not be any faster than walking in forests or mountains.  
**_Forced March_**: If the party wants to traverse more hexes, they can travel for up to 16 hours in a single day, instead of the normal 8. Each additional hour risks [exhaustion](https://github.com/AB-1010/DnD/#exhaustion) and a DC 10 + 1 for each hour CON Save must be made at the end of the hour.  
**_Stealth_** Traveling undetected relies on spotting threats before they spot you. See the **On Watch** activity, described later.  
**_Rotating Shifts_**: If the party is traveling on a vehicle large enough for them to rest, and the creatures operating the vehicle (such as horses, oarsmen, boiler room workers, or captain) can change at least every 8 hours, the party can travel for 24 hours a day.

___
### Travel Activities  
This section outlines the activities that a character can perform while traveling.

Each character can perform one activity per day.  
**_Rangers_**: Rangers can perform two activities per day.  
**_Outlander Background_**: The Wanderer feature is replaced with the following  
> In addition to your normal choice of activity when traveling, you can perform the Navigate or Forage activity.

**_DC's_**: I am just going to put them in a table in the end so that everyone knows them and doesn't need to keep asking me. Just take the Activity DC and add the DC Modifiers.  
**_Multiple environments_**: All activities and encounters occur in the most common environment traveled through that day.  
**_Multiple characters_**: If multiple characters perform the same activity, each character rolls as normal and only the highest result is used.  

#### Navigate  
You navigate the wilderness, aiming to keep track of where you are and not get lost. _Can you not metagame if you do get lost?_  
The DC is determined by the environment the party is traveling through and any relevant modifiers, as described in the Activity DC tables.   
On a success, the party follows the planned route. On a failure, the party is lost.  
If the DC is 0 or less, the party cannot get lost (and therefore does not require a navigator)  
**_Proficiencies_**: Wisdom (Survival), Intelligence (Navigator's Tools).  
**_Being Lost_**: If the party becomes lost, The DM tells the party what environment they are in and describes and landmarks in the hex, but does not give them any more information than that. It is up to the party to solve their predicament!  

#### Forage  
You forage for food and water. The DC is determined by the environment the party is in and any relevant modifiers, as described in the Activity DC tables.  
On a success, you find enough food and water to feed the PCs for the day. If you beat the DC by more than 10, you also find enough for the PCs' mounts and close companions. Each unfed creature consumes 5sp/2 lbs of rations for the day or loses 1 Hit Die. If they have no remaining Hit Dice, or do not eat or drink for a number of days equal to their Constitution modifier, they gain a level of exhaustion.  
**_Proficiencies_**: Int or Wis (Survival or Nature)  
I will assume if the party is traveling with a vehicle or mount, they are carrying a barrel containing a week's worth of water.  
Magic below 3rd level cannot provide hydration.  

#### Search  
You are tracking a creature or searching for something. Regardless of what you are searching for, calculate the DC (you know the process by now). On a success, choose one of the following:  
* You find what you are looking for, if the DM knows it is in the hexes you traveled through.  
* Roll d10+10, and choose whether to replace the DM's Encounter roll for the day with the new roll (you will not know what was previously rolled). If an Environment Hazard has already been introduced, the roll would be in addition the the Hazard, instead of replacing it.  
**_Proficiencies_**: Int or Wis (Survival, Investigation, or Perception)  

#### Support  
You help the party handle the wilderness with supporting tasks like preparing meals or alcohol, tending to injuries, or repairing shoes or gear.   
The DC is 10 + the average party level. On a success, the party does not lose a Hit Die for sleeping in the wild that day, and other party members can add a d4 to their Activity checks.  
**_Proficiencies_**: Intelligence or Wisdom (Medicine, Cook’s Utensils or Brewer’s Supplies), Intelligence or Strength (Cobbler’s Tools), Intelligence or Dexterity (Weaver’s Tools).  

#### Motivate  
You motivate the party to keep the pace up by playing music, coaching, persuading or intimidating the party.  
The DC is 10 + the average party level. On a success, the first 3 hours of a forced march that day don’t risk [Exhaustion](https://github.com/AB-1010/DnD/#exhaustion), and players can add a d4 to any initiative checks that day.  
**_Proficiencies_**: Charisma (Persuasion), Strength or Charisma (Intimidate or Athletics), Wisdom or Charisma (Musical Instrument).  

#### On Watch  
You vigilantly keep a look out for creatures and hazards. If other creatures are also on watch, spotting them before they spot the party requires a succeeding at a contested Wisdom (Perception) check. Otherwise you always spot them first. Seeing creatures early allows the party to avoid them using normal stealth rules, if desired.  
You also have a chance to spot some Environment Hazards more quickly, using the environment’s Search DC.    
**_Proficiencies_**: Wisdom (Perception).  

#### Utilize Vehicle  
Whether its skillful control, tender caring of animals, or clever adjustments, vehicles and mounts can be pushed to travel faster.  
The DC to utilize a vehicle (or mount) in this way is determined by the environment the party is in and any relevant modifiers, as described in the Activity DC tables. On a success, the first 3 hours of a forced march that day don’t cost Hit Dice, and you have advantage on any checks or saving throws made to control the vehicle (or mount).    
**_Proficiencies_**: Dexterity, Intelligence or Wisdom (Vehicle (Land or Water)), Wisdom (Animal Handling), Strength or Intelligence (Carpenter’s, Smith’s, or Tinker’s tools).  

#### Chronicle  
You chronicle the party’s journey, creating a record such as drawings, songs, poems, a journal, or maps. Any chronicle you create has a set amount of value, either in gold pieces or services. For example you could recount the chronicle at taverns for free food and beds, or sell copies of the work to a library or guild.  
Roll an ability check with one of the skills or toolkits below that you are proficient with. The chronicle has a gp value equal to half the result (rounded up). The value is doubled if you discover a new location or creature in the area.  
If you roll above the environment’s navigation DC, the party can travel the same route without making a navigation check in future. This includes backtracking if you become lost.  
**_Proficiencies_**: Intelligence (History, Performance, Musical Instrument, Forgery kit or Cartographer’s tools), Intelligence or Dexterity (Calligrapher’s or Painter’s supplies).  

#### Craft (Multiple)  
Each day, you gather materials from the environment and craft one of the following, depending on the toolkit you use. The DCs are presented in the Activity DC table.  
* **_Magic Ink_**: You find a faintly magical liquid in a plant or carcass, and either scribe a cantrip or 1st level spell you know, or create a letter or artwork that causes the first viewer to be under the effect of the Suggestion spell. Roll Intelligence or Wisdom (Forgery kit, Painter’s or Calligrapher’s supplies, Cartographer’s tools).
* **_Poison_**: You find ingredients and create a mild poison. It is an ingestion or injury poison, and causes the target to become poisoned for an hour if they fail a DC 15 Constitution Saving Throw. Roll Intelligence or Wisdom (Brewer’s or Alchemist’s supplies, Cook’s utensils, Herbalism or Poisoner’s kit).
* **_Potion of Healing_**: You find ingredients and create a potion of healing. Roll Intelligence or Wisdom (Herbalism or Poisoner’s kit, or Alchemist’s supplies).
* **_Sharpened Weapon_**: You find strange wood, a high-quality whetstone, or something similarly appropriate. With the materials you craft or sharpen a weapon. It deals +5 damage the first time it hits. Roll Dexterity or Wisdom (Mason’s, Smith’s, Tinker’s, Jeweler’s, Woodcarver’s or Carpenter’s tools).
* **_Special material_**: At the DM’s discretion, you can also gather materials to craft other things, though some may take longer than a day to make or require more materials.
* **_Temporary Protection_**: You find materials and craft a makeshift piece of protective equipment. It provides +2 AC for up to 7 days until it prevents an attack that would otherwise hit the wearer. Roll Strength or Wisdom (Woodcarver’s, Carpenter’s, Leatherworker’s, Cobbler’s, Potter’s or Weaver’s tools).
___
### Downtime
#### Travelling  
Player characters can travel for 8 hours a day during downtime without risking random encounters or attempting activities. However unless they are travelling on a road (or aboard a passenger ship), they can only travel through hexes they have previously travelled through.

#### Activities 
With a week of downtime, a PC can successfully complete one of the following Activities without risk (assuming they meet any proficiency requirements):

*   Search the area, at the DM’s discretion. 
*   Chronicle the goings-on in the area for a week.   
*   Craft one of the listed items. Special materials are still at the DM’s discretion.
___
#### Exhaustion
Level | Effect
:---: | ---
1 | Disadvantage on ability checks (not saving throws)
2 | Speed Halved
3 | Disadvantage on attack roles and saving throws
4 | Max HP halved
5 | Speed reduced to 0
6 | **DEATH**
___
#### Crafting Magic Items  
To craft magical items, one needs a special resource known as **_Flux_** and the required materials worth in gold.  
Flux is made of a jagged, shimmering crystal material that slowly changes color over time. It is considered magical, and emanates turbulent magical energy. One piece of flux can fit in the palm of a human hand, and weighs 1 lb. Flux is too unreliable to be part of a larger economy.  

__Disenchanting__  
To disenchant a magic item, it takes half the time it would take to craft the item, and results in the creation of half as many flux pieces as it would take to craft the item. The item is destroyed in the process. It does not require any gold to disenchant a magic item. If a magic item has a limited number of charges and cannot be recharged, the number of flux pieces created from disenchanting it is reduced proportionally. Flux cannot be used to craft potions or scrolls, nor can they be disenchanted.
___
#### "Active" Ability Checks  
When the DM proposes an ability or skill check, they choose a DC based on how the players have described their characters performing the task.
The DM tells the players the DC before any dice are rolled – the characters are assumed to be competent enough to assess the difficulty of a task before they attempt it.  
The players then have the option to either attempt the ability check, or decide on a different course of action. This can include altering how they approach the task in order to make it easier, in which case the DM would be open to lowering the DC. Or if the solution is clever enough, an ability check might not be necessary at all! This can be particularly appropriate when navigating hazards.  
<sub>Ability checks are more than just dice rolls. Ability checks are an opportunity for roleplaying. Describing how a character does something can often be more interesting than the dice roll itself.</sub>

___
### Characteristics  

Each player character can have up to five characteristics: one personality trait, one bond, one ideal, one flaw, and a fifth characteristic of any type. These characteristics can be selected from the usual tables during character creation, but should be customized as the characters change during play.   
Any number of characteristics can be changed between sessions, to better reflect the character.  
You should be able to imagine at least one way in which each of your characteristics might come up in play. If you can’t, rewrite the characteristic until you can.
___
### INSPIRATION! CHECK IT, SUCKAS!

#### Benefits of Inspiration
Inspiration can be used to gin one of the following benefits:
* **Your roll**: Roll an additional d20 on any roll you make. You can use this ability after the original roll, but before the outcome is revealed.
* **Your enemy's roll**: After an enemy rolls a saving throw against an effect you made, roll a d20 and choose whether an enemy uses their roll or yours.
* **_Flashback_**: You have a "flashback" to something in the past where you did something small, such as buying a healing potion or other gear, learning information, or casting a ritual spell.

#### Using Inspiration
To use inspiration, you call on one of your five personal characteristics. The characteristic should be relevant to the current situation, ideally motivating the action the character is making/taking at the time.

It's up to you how connected your chosen characteristic is to the scene - the DM won't deny you your use of Inspiration. That said, players are encouraged to portray something about their character, whether it is a silly one-liner, yelling something dramatic, or revealing something about their character's backstory or feelings.

You can only use Inspiration once per round or skill challenge.

#### Making Characteristics
When a characteristic is called on for Inspiration, put a mark next to it. It cannot be called on again until it is renewed. A maximum of three characteristics can be marked at any given time.

#### Renewing Inspiration
You can renew one of your character's characteristics in the following ways:

* **Recap**: Summarize the events of the previous session (also known as an After Action Report) either after the session ends or at the start of the next session provided nobody has done it yet. Only one player can do this per session.
* **Temptation**: If any player (including you, or the DM) notices a situation where a characteristic of your PC might make the situation more complicated, they can propose a temptation. 
If you accept the temptation, you must roleplay the characteristic in a way that complicates the situation. In exchange, you can renew any one of your characteristics.
If you propose a temptation for your own character, it is up to the DM whether to accept or refuse it. Examples of complications include insulting an important/key NPC, stealing something, or letting your curiosity, pride or honor get best of you.
* **At Death's Door**: Whenever you fail a saving throw to end being incapacitated or unconcious (for example, being stunned or at 0 hit points), you can describe a past experience "flashing before your eyes". It should be something the group does not already know, such as a moment from your backstory, and be related to the characteristic you wish to renew.
* **Growth**: If your character grows or changes through the course of play, at the end of the session you can change or replace a relevant characteristic (do inform the DM) to reflect the change. Doing so renews that characteristic. This type of renewal will occur less often than the other types.
<sub>Character growth would not happen every session, but when it does happen it can be a lot of fun. Say, a character might have an ideal, "Honour above all else!", but during the session have to sacrifice their honor in order to save their friend. Clearly honor was NOT above all else! How the player updates their character's ideal to reflect the change is how the character grows, and the player is rewarded for that growth in Inspiration and XP</sub>

___
#### Called Shots
When plausible in the fiction of battle, you can make a "called shot", where you attack a specific part of a creature, or an object the creature is holding or wearing. The DM decides what the effect will be for succeeding before you commit to making a called shot. Examples of appropriate effects are included in the examples table.

Making a called shot **requires having advantage** on the attack, and the cost of making a called shot is that you **lose advantage**. If the attack hits, the called shot is successful: you deal damage as normal, and the target suffers from the effect.

You can make up to one called shot per round. Creatures can only be affected by one called shot at a time. NPCs can also make called shots.   
**Effect Duration**: Bodily injuries should be temporary, lasting until the end of your next turn. An example, shooting a Cyclops's eye only bruises it for a round, instead of permanently blinding them. Other effects, such as disarming them, last until voluntarily fixed.  
__Examples__
Too Weak | Appropriate | Too Strong
---|---|---
-10 ft speed | Loses flying speed | Paralyzed
-4 on next attack | Blinded | Stunned 
Disadv. on a skill | Disadv. on a saving throw (incl. concentration) | Disadv. on multiple saving throws
-4 damage | Diarmed | Halved damage
